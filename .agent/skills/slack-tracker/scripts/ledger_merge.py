"""Merge two versions of the Slack mention ledger without losing either.

`slack_mention_ledger.json` is a whole-document snapshot, and `save_state` used
to replace it outright from whatever the writing process held in memory. That is
safe while one machine writes and fatal the moment two do: the second write is
built on a picture that never contained the first machine's records, so it
deletes them, silently and with no conflict to notice.

That is not hypothetical here. CLAUDE.md records 17 Aug 2026, when two records
added on macOS at 11:53 were removed fourteen minutes later by a WSL sweep that
wrote back its own complete snapshot. `ledger_lock` cannot prevent it, because
`fcntl` covers one filesystem and these are two machines.

So a write stops being a replacement and becomes a merge. The rule that makes it
safe is that a merge may only **add or advance**:

* an item present on either side survives
* an item on both sides resolves to the more advanced of the two
* a watermark takes the larger value
* nothing is ever reverted to an earlier state

Deletion then needs its own answer, because a pure union can never forget
anything. It gets one that needs no coordination: retention is re-applied after
the union, using the same deterministic rule both machines already run in
`prune`. A terminal record past its retention window is dropped by whichever
machine writes next, and both agree on which records those are without talking.

The same function backs the git merge driver, so two commits that both touch this
file resolve by union instead of asking a person to pick a side, which is the
other way half the ledger disappears.
