"""Commit and push everything a session produced, not only the ledgers.

Why this exists: on 11 Aug 2026 seven parallel sessions left 49 uncommitted
paths in this checkout. `ledger_sync.py` had already pushed the four state
ledgers, so `ledger_sync status` reported everything healthy while Dashboard.md,
the Clients/ documents and every journal note written that day existed on one
laptop only. origin/main is the source of truth (CLAUDE.md): until a file is
pushed, no other session, agent, cron job or machine can see it.

ledger_sync.py deliberately stages a fixed SYNC_PATHS allowlist, because a
ledger write has to land as its own reviewable commit. This script covers the
complement -- the rest of the working tree -- at end of turn.

Two things make an unattended blanket commit safe enough to run on every turn:

  * A secret screen. Anything whose filename or contents look like a credential
    is left uncommitted and named in the output, instead of being pushed to a
    remote and then rewritten out of history. .gitignore already covers the
    credentials that exist today; the screen is for the ones added tomorrow.
  * One writer at a time. Sessions run in parallel in this checkout, so the
    whole read-stage-commit-push cycle holds a shared 'git' lock from
    ledger_lock.py. Without it, two Stop hooks race on .git/index.lock and one
    of them silently commits nothing.

Usage:
    worktree_sync.py status                  # what would be committed, no writes
    worktree_sync.py sync                    # commit + push
    worktree_sync.py sync --dry-run          # same report as status
    worktree_sync.py sync --reason "..."     # commit subject tail
    worktree_sync.py sync --no-push          # commit locally only

Kill switches: WORKTREE_SYNC_DISABLE=1 skips everything (exit 0);
LEDGER_SYNC_OFFLINE=1 commits but makes no network call.
