"""
Cross-process lock for the JSON state ledgers.

Why this exists
---------------
On 3 Aug 2026 three waiting-on records and four commitments vanished. The
ledger writers were not corrupting files: they already write to a temp file
and os.replace() it, which is atomic. The loss came from a plain
read-modify-write race between separate processes:

    harvest  reads 420 items
    sweep    reads 420 items
    harvest  writes 421          <- its new record lands
    sweep    writes its own 421  <- harvest's record is now gone

Atomic replace guarantees the file is never half written. It guarantees
nothing about a second process having read the old contents first. With 19
cron jobs on this repo, 7 of which write ledgers, overlap is a matter of
when rather than whether, and the failure is silent: no error, no corrupt
file, just a record that quietly stops existing.

Usage
-----
Acquire once at process start and hold for the whole run. These are short
CLI invocations, so serialising entire runs is simpler and safer than
trying to bracket each read-modify-write pair:

    from ledger_lock import hold_ledger_lock
    hold_ledger_lock('commitments')     # exits with a clear message on timeout

or as a context manager around a narrower section:

    with ledger_lock('commitments'):
        state = load_state()
        ...
        save_state(state)

The lock is advisory (fcntl.flock), so it only protects processes that ask
for it. Any new writer to journal/state/*.json must call this too.

On Windows there is no `fcntl`, so the primitive is `msvcrt.locking` over a
one-byte range instead. Same semantics for our purposes: exclusive, advisory,
non-blocking, released when the handle closes. Without this shim every ledger
command run from a Windows session died at import with ModuleNotFoundError,
which is how the Stop hook started failing on 16 Sep 2026.
