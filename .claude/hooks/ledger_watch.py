"""PostToolUse hook: notice when something tracked was acted on, and remember it.

Two jobs.

1. Catch hand-edits. `journal/state/*.json` is written by the ledger CLIs, which
   take the ledger lock and propagate the change. Opening one in an editor does
   neither, so the edit races the next cron sweep and reaches no other session.
   `journal/master_followup_tracker.md` is a generated view; typing into it is
   overwritten on the next render. Both get a warning here.

2. Record discharge actions. Sending the Slack message, publishing the doc,
   transitioning the ticket - each of those is usually the moment a commitment,
   a waiting-on, or a decision stops being open. The record is what the next
   session reads, so an action without a matching record update is invisible
   work: the ledger keeps reporting it as outstanding and someone chases it
   again. This hook writes the action to a per-session file; `ledger_guard.py`
   checks at the end of the turn whether a record followed.

Contract: always exit 0. Never blocks a tool call.
